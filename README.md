# PasswordGenerator
A random and strong password generator in c++ with absolutely no complications. 

The program will generate passwords totally random, but the length of the password can be a bit long.

Actually if you enter the length of 8 the password generated will be long enough like at least average.

You can control the lenght of the generated passwords, if you want to generate passwords under 7 characters long, i will add separate functionality for that ;).
